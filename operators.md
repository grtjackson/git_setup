# OPERATORS

## ++counter
' prefix, increments first'

## counter++
'postfix, increments after'

### prefix
'let counter = 1;
let a = ++counter; // increments first, returns 2
console.log(a); //2

The prefix will return the value after it has incremented,
the console will log 2.'

### postfix
'let counter = 1;
let a = counter++; //returns 1, then increments
console.log(a); //a

The postfix will return the current value (1) before adding the increment,
the console will log 1 but the counter is now 2 internally.


There's often no real difference between the two, most programmers use postfix
for stylistic reasons or out of habit, others will use prefix because they
prefer the logic.'



### No assignment
'++counter;
counter++;

both of these increment by 1 when there is no return value.'
